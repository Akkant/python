# Math Agent with LangGraph ðŸ§ âž•âž–

This is a simple AI agent built using LangGraph. It takes math expressions like `2+3` or `100-9` and decides whether to add or subtract the numbers.

## ðŸ§© How it works

- `tools.py`: Contains math functions (`add`, `sub`)
- `nodes.py`: Decides what operation to perform
- `graph.py`: Builds and runs the LangGraph

## ðŸš€ Run the agent

```bash
python graph.py
